# So Much Websockets

This is the example application as described in my blog [post](http://benjamintanweihao.github.io/blog/2014/02/12/phoenix-elixir-web-framework-and-websockets/).

To start your new Phoenix application you have to:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix router with `mix run -e 'SoMuchWebsockets.Config.Router.start' --no-halt mix.exs`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
